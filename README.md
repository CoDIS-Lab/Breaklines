## Overview

Line-breaking passes (LBPs) are a cornerstone of vertical progression and attacking structure in football. This project introduces a clustering-based method to detect LBPs from synchronised event and tracking data, modelling opponent defensive shape dynamically at the moment of each pass.

BreakLines further introduces two key tactical metrics:
- **SBR (Space Buildup Ratio):** Quantifies the spatial advantage gained from a pass.
- **LBPCh¬π & LBPCh¬≤:** Capture direct and chained progression sequences that culminate in goal-scoring attempts.

Our approach combines spatial logic with tactical relevance to uncover the structure behind dangerous build-up sequences ‚Äî without relying on proprietary labels or pre-defined formations.

## üîß Features

- üß† **Unsupervised Clustering:** Dynamic vertical segmentation of defensive lines using K-Means with adaptive `k` (‚â•2 clusters).
- üìä **SBR Metric:** Interpretable spatial impact score based on area expansion around receivers.
- üîÑ **Chain Analysis:** Detection of chained LBPs (LBPCh¬≤) for sustained vertical build-ups.
- ‚öΩ **Player/Team Analysis:** Identify top line-breakers, space creators, and tactical contributors.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

Uses the [PFF FC World Cup 2022 Dataset](https://www.blog.fc.pff.com/blog/pff-fc-release-2022-world-cup-data) which includes:
- Event data (passes, duels, shots)
- Tracking data at 29.97Hz for all players and ball
- Roster, meta, and alignment information for full context
